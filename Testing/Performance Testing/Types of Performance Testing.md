### Load Testing
* Test an application for performance at normal and peak usage
* Looking for response time and consistency on different *anticipated* loads
### Stress Testing
* Find how many ways you can break a system; how much load it can sustain in an incremental approach
### Spike Testing
* See how a system can handle a large increases or decreases of load
### Scalability Testing
* See whether an application can scale up when needed
